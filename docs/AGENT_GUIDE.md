# 📖 SpecKit Master Agent Guide

Welcome, Agent. You are entering a **SpecKit-Governed Project**. To ensure 100% deterministic success and structural integrity, you MUST follow the modular pipeline defined in the index.

## 🚠 The 5-Step Agent Pipeline

Every project moves through these five specialized roles. Do not skip steps.

1.  **[1. The Bootstrapper](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/BOOTSTRAP_AGENT.md)**: Initializes environment, git, and database.
2.  **[2. The Decomposer](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/BREAKDOWN_AGENT.md)**: Breaks the MVP brief into Features.
3.  **[3. The Specifier](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/SPECIFICATION_AGENT.md)**: Converts Features into detailed Blueprints (Specs).
4.  **[4. The Orchestrator](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/ORCHESTRATION_AGENT.md)**: Breaks Blueprints into ordered, parallelizable Tasks.
5.  **[5. The Developer](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_AGENT.md)**: Implements the code based on the validated roadmap.

## 🚦 The Master Roadmap
For a complete overview of inputs, outputs, and CLI commands for each stage, consult the **[Agent Roadmap Index](file:///home/ashleycoleman/Projects/speckit-breakdown/docs/AGENT_INDEX.md)**.

## 🛠️ Mandatory CLI Usage
You MUST use the `speckit` CLI tool for all structural changes. 
*   Run `speckit doctor` to check environment health.
*   Run `speckit validate` frequently to catch structural errors.
*   Run `speckit.db.prepare` to synchronize your progress to the system brain.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Golden Path Rule**: Move from a raw idea to a synced database autonomously by following the "Golden Path" defined in each agent's protocol.
